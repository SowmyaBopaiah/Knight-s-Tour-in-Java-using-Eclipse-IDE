# Knight-s-Tour-in-Java-using-Eclipse-IDE
The knight in chess can jump in a special manner that is it can move either two squares horizontally and one square vertically or two squares vertically and one square horizontally in each direction, the complete movement looks like English letter ‘L’. This project basically deals with problem, that the knight starting from any location in the board should move in 'L' shape to all the tiles in the board such that it visits each tile only once.

The above project is achieved by using two algorithm:
1. Warnsdorf's Algorithm.
2. Backtracking Algorithm.

Two diffrents algorithms are used in order to compare the efficiency between them. It gives a clear picture on which algorithm is best suited and more efficient in solving similar problems. This project also helps us to record the time taken by the two algorithms to find the result.
